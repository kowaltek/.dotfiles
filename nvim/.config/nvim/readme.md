# Go config

Add interface implementation to 'crispgm/nvim-go'.

# Obsidian

Set `<leader>oo` to open obsidian and `<leader>os` to obsidian search.
There's also a mapping for `gf` to follow a link to other note setup to not collide with other `gf` mappings (works only when cursor is over an obsidian link).
